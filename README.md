# Binomial.py
Quick stats for Binomial probability
This file takes in :
  -nr of trials
  -desired stochastic variable value
  -probability

and returns the Probability that \xi = desired variable value

Quick disclaimer: the file must be compiled first if you 
want to use it from Command Line.
                  Colors may not work in the Python Shell 
but their code will be displayed.

This is meant as a code here but due to it's simplicity it 
would be better as a part of a custom library
